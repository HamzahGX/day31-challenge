Summary of the identified vulnerabilities and risks in the application:

1.Weak Authentication:
   - The use of a hardcoded username and plain-text password makes authentication insecure.

2.Password Security:
   - Storing passwords in plain text is a security risk; passwords should be securely hashed and salted.

3.Insecure Session Management:
   - Session management lacks secure configurations and HTTPS usage.

4.CSRF Vulnerability:
   - Minimal configuration for CSRF protection, which should be strengthened.

5.Client-Side Redirect Risk:
   - Unvalidated redirect after login poses a risk of phishing attacks.

6.Input Validation and Sanitization:
   - Inadequate input validation and sanitization expose the app to injection attacks.

Addressing these issues is crucial for enhancing the application's security.
